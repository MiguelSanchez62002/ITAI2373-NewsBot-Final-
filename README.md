# 🤖 NewsBot 2.0 — Smart News Analysis Project

## 📌 What Is NewsBot 2.0?
NewsBot 2.0 is a smart computer program that can **read, understand, and talk about news articles**.  
It uses AI to figure out:
- What a news article is about
- How people in the article are feeling
- Who and what is mentioned
- How to explain it in a simpler way

It can even **translate different languages** and answer your questions about the news.
